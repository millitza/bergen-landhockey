Field hockey is a team sport under the Bandy Association, with its roots in Pakistan, England, and the Netherlands. While similar to bandy, it differs in equipment, playing surface, and game style. In the summer, we play outdoor on a grass pitch with 11 players per team (10 outfield + 1 goalkeeper). In winter, we move indoors to play fast-paced 6-a-side matches with sideboards.
