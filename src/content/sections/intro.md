Field hockey is a hockey discipline under the Bandy Association with roots from Pakistan, England, and the Netherlands.
In spring and summer, the sport is played outdoors on a grass pitch. Both teams have 11 players on the field, 10 outfield players, and 1 goalkeeper.
Field hockey sticks are wooden and left-handed, and goals are scored with a small hard ball at 5-a-side goals.
In winter, there are indoor training and matches with 6 players and sidboards.
The aim of the game is to score the most goals against the opposing team.
